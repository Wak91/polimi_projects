Rationale for __atexit.patch
----------------------------

Miosix has never called the finalizers registered with atexit(),
onexit() and cxa_atexit() when main returned, and this because
in a microcontroller system main() is not expected to return. 

However, the finalizers and their parameters in the
cxa_atexit case (which is automatically called by gcc on every
global C++ object), were still allocated taking up RAM

This patch does not make Miosix call the finalizers, it avoids
storing tham so that no memory is wasted for a broken feature.
