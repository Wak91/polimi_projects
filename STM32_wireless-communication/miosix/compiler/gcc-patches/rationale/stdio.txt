Rationale for stdio.patch
-------------------------

BUFSIZ is used as buffer size in many parts of libc, including
- as a stack allocated buffer in _vfprintf_r
- as default file buffer for any file, including stdin and stdout

The default value og 1KB is simply too big for a small microcontroller,
so it was reduced to 512Bytes
