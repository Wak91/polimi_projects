This example shows how to synchronize between a thread and a DMA peripheral.

To run this example, copy the content of this directory into the top level
directory.
Since the code is designed to run with an stm32vldiscovery, follow the kernel
configuration procedure for this board here:

To be able to hear the audio file, build one of the two circuits found in
the circuit.jpeg file. The top one is a speaker amplifier, the bottom one
is a filter whose output is suitable to drive an amplified speaker
(such as a PC speaker).
