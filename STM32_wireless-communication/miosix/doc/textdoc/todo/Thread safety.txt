Thread safety issues:
This is a (probably incomplete) list of parts of the C/C++ standard
library that require locks or atomic ops for thread safety.

- malloc, but newlib already provides __malloc_lock() and __malloc_unlock()
  that take care of this issue.
  FIXED

- newlib/libc/stdlib/__atexit.c
  FIXED
  As per new newlib patch, atexit has become a no-op and therefore locking
  is no longer required.

- newlib stdio library, seems to require locks here and there for files.
  It also looks there's a mutex in every FILE struct.
  FIXED

- libsupc++/guard.cc
  Requres a thread safe implementation of code to call the constructor
  of any static class declared inside a function.
  TODO

- libsupc++/eh_alloc.cc
  Requires a mutex for allocation of memory in the emergency buffer.
  TODO

- libsupc++/eh_globals.cc
  Requires a per-thread instance of some data structure.
  TODO
